Hello! This is a file you can download to have some fun! There isn't a lot as you expected, but i can do it.
If i want to update it, i can.
This may not work on other computers because of the code not working on other devices.
## Extras
* All HTML files was made in Sublime Text.
* All HTML files was tested on a browser called Google Chrome.
* Most of these buttons working uses JavaScript so if you have it disabled... Turn. It. ON.
## Credits

## Installation
* This tab shows you how to run the HTML pages.
### Requirements
1. Download the program on the Releases.
2. You atleast need a web browser to run it. (Google chrome, Microsoft edge, whatever browser that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.)
### Running it
1. So you have to go to your file browser. (File Explorer for Windows, Finder for Macs, but you need your file explorer.)
2. Find your file you installed (It should have "HTML5 pages.zip" in it's name)
